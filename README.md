# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Description
A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.


## User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

## What this application does:
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated




## Applicaiton information:

This application uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash or terminal
node index.js
```

The directory is as follows:

```md
__tests__/			// jest tests
  Employee.test.js
  Engineer.test.js
  Intern.test.js
  Manager.test.js
dist/               // rendered output (HTML) and CSS style sheet
lib/				// classes
inputFile/				// template helper code
index.js			// runs the application
```

The application include `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes. The tests for these classes (in the `_tests_` directory) and it all pass.

The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and methods:

* `name`

* `id`

* `email`

* `getName()`

* `getId()`

* `getEmail()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;returns `'Employee'`

The other three classes will extend `Employee`.

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have the following:

* `officeNumber`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Manager'`

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Engineer` will also have the following:

* `github`&mdash;GitHub username

* `getGithub()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Engineer'`

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Intern` will also have the following:

* `school`

* `getSchool()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Intern'`

Added validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.


* A sample HTML file generated using the application must be submitted.

* Your GitHub repository containing your application code.
